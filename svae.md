                    I graduated from Kalamazoo College in June of 2024 with my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science.

                    Since March 2023, I've been a Software Engineer at Maxar Technologies, where I've had the opportunity 
                    to take on a variety of roles. From building a full-stack satellite image viewing application to parallelizing 
                    that very application and updating legacy Java code, I've gained invaluable experience. Each project has expanded 
                    my skill set, and for that, I'm grateful.

                    In collaboration with Maxar Technologies and Kalamazoo College, under the guidance of Dr. Sandino Vargas-PÃ©rez, 
                    I conducted research focused on software engineering techniques, with a particular emphasis on parallelization in 
                    server-loading large satellite images. I'm honored that this project earned me the distinction of Honors.

                    Recently, my interests have shifted toward computer science and computing education, prompting me to delve deeper 
                    into these areas while continuing to refine my skills in other technical domains. This is all part of my preparation
                     to apply to PhD programs, where I hope to explore CS education from a social perspective and investigate how topics 
                     at the intersection of Green Computing can enhance the human condition.
